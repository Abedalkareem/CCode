// static analysis is a method of debugging by automaticlly examining source code before a programm is run
// - do not actually run the program.
// - contrast with dynamic analysis (profiling), analysis performed on programs while they are executing.

// the analyusis is performed oon some version of the source code.

// the process provides an understanding of the code structure, and can help to ensure that the code adheres to industry standards.

// this type of analysis addresses weaknesses in source code that might lead to vulnerbilities.
// could also be achieved through manual code reviews.

// analysis is ooften performed by an autoomated tool
// much more effective than code reviews

// the sophistication of the analysis performed by tools varies
// from those that only consider the behavior oof individual statements and declarations.
// to those that include the complete source code of a program in their analysis.

// software metrics and reverse engineering can be described as forms of static analysis.

// tools: CodeSonar
